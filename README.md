# What is this?
These tables combines the points of [NWSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Women%27s_Soccer_League) and [MLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer) teams to determine soccer's Big Winner.

# K, but why?
...to determine soccer's Big Winner.

Let's consider an English example. In the 2018-2019 season, Liverpool F.C. has done [quite well](https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/liverpool-premier-league-records-most-goals-points-unbeaten-run-earliest-title-man-city-chelsea-man-utd) in the Premier League; however, they're dead last and facing relegation in the FA Women's Super League.

Livepool F.C. is not a Big Winner.

Big Winner's invest in, develop, and promote both the women's and men's games. They should be determined by combining the points of each team.

# The Rules
Dunno! Rules are TBD—please make suggestions!

Currently teams are paired, loosely, by geographic region (should formal partnerships be required?). That is, if an NWSL team and an MLS team operate in the same city (or close to it), they are paired as a row in the table, and their points are added together to determine their total (should the points be weighted when one league plays fewer matches?).

If an NWSL or MLS team lacks a counterpart in the other league, they remain in the table, but receive no points for the team that doesn't exist. If they want those points, they should get a team in the other league (or partner with one? again, what should the rules be here?).

The Big Winner is determined by the pair with the highest point total in the table.

Proposed first tie-breaker: goals scored by the team in a pairing that represents the league with fewer total teams (so currently, that'd mean goals scored by the NWSL side in a pair—again, if there is no NWSL side, then you probably won't win this tie).

# Next Steps
- Formalizing the rules
- Coming up with a really wonderful name :thinking:
- Creating an actual trophy??!
- Awarding an actual trophy to the Big Winner every year?
