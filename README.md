# What is this?
An annual award, organized by supporters, for the teams with the best combined [NWSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Women%27s_Soccer_League) and [MLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer) seasons.


# K, but why?
To determine soccer's Big Winner, yo.

Let's consider an English example. Recently, Liverpool F.C. has done [quite well](https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/liverpool-premier-league-records-most-goals-points-unbeaten-run-earliest-title-man-city-chelsea-man-utd) in the Premier League. At the same time, they're facing relegation in the FA Women's Super League.

Livepool F.C. is not a Big Winner. Big Winners invest in, develop, and promote both the women's and men's games. They should be determined by combining the points of each team.

# The Rules
Dunno! Rules are a work-in-progressâ€”please make suggestions!

Teams are (currently) paired, loosely, by geographic region (should formal partnerships be required, though?). That is, if an NWSL team and an MLS team operate in the same city (or sort of the same city), they are paired as a row in the table. The pair's points are added together to determine their position in the table. (Should the points be weighted somehow when one league plays fewer matches?).

If an NWSL or MLS team lacks a counterpart, they remain in the table, but receive no points for the team that... doesn't exist. If they want those points, they should get a team in the other league (or partner with one? again, what should the rules be here?).

Proposed first tie-breaker: goals scored by the team from the under-represented league (so currently, that would mean goals scored by the NWSL side).

# Next Steps
- Formalizing the rules
- Coming up with a really wonderful name :thinking:
- Creating an actual trophy??!
- Awarding the actual trophy to the actual teams
